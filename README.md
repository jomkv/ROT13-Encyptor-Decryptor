# ROT13-Encyptor-Decryptor
PS: This is my first ever project so if you think it's messy, I know it is lol. I am pretty new to programming, I have been learning Python for a few months now and I am a
slow learner that's why I have not made much progress so far. 

If you have any suggestion on a fun project that I could do next, feel free to tell me. 

PSPS: If you're also new to Python/Programming maybe we can be buddies and learn together :) 
my discord is woozy#2938
